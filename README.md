# Selego Style Guide

## Introduction
This guide provides standards and best practices for developing projects at Selego, ensuring consistency, readability, and maintainability of our code.

### Purpose
To establish a consistent coding style and workflow for all projects, making collaboration easier and reducing technical debt.

### Why It's Important to Converge to the Same Tech
- **Consistency:** Code should look like it was written by a single person.
- **Quality:** It's better to be consistently BAD than non-consistently GOOD.
- **Guidelines:** The whitepaper is OUR style guide. We should FOLLOW it. Simple as that.
- **Adaptation:** Want to change the whitepaper? Use this meeting to discuss.

*I promise I will never ask someone to do differently than in whitepaper publicly*
- Hugo Lecourt | Th√©o Le Magueresse

# Selego Style Guide

## Introduction
This guide provides standards and best practices for developing projects at Selego, ensuring consistency, readability, and maintainability of our code.

### Purpose
To establish a consistent coding style and workflow for all projects, making collaboration easier and reducing technical debt.

### Why It's Important to Converge to the Same Tech
- **Consistency:** Code should look like it was written by a single person.
- **Quality:** It's better to be consistently BAD than non-consistently GOOD.
- **Guidelines:** The whitepaper is OUR style guide. We should FOLLOW it. Simple as that.
- **Adaptation:** If you disagree with something in the whitepaper, write a message in [#whitepaper](https://slack.com/app_redirect?channel=C06Q7TFKTV0) channel in slack. 

### Audience
All Selego developers working on 0 to 1 projects or scale-ups.

### Scope
This guide covers repository structure, branching strategy, commit messages, pull requests, code reviews, coding standards, issue tracking, documentation, automation, security, and best practices, specifically tailored for MERN stack, React Native.
